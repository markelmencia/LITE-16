# LITE-16
A 16-bit Instruction Set Architecture
\
\
LITE-16 is a simple 16-bit Instruction Set Architecture, inspired by [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/), the open-source ISA by the University of California, Berkeley. For more information about LITE-16, be sure to read the project documentation in this repository.

The electronic architecture was designed with [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/), an open-source software by Carl Burch. More information on his website. I left a sample program in the circuit folder that can be loaded into the Program Memory ROM, that tests every instruction type.
